## My College Project: Employee and Member Information Management System

During my second year in college, I undertook the development of a comprehensive Employee and Member Information Management System. I took the lead in producing the Java Project and the UML Design, while also contributing to the Figma design phase with other members.

This system aims to streamline the management of member and employee information. It will feature a user-friendly graphical interface for recording and displaying pertinent information as required. Additionally, the system will incorporate data persistence functionality to ensure seamless operation across multiple program executions.

### Project Components

The project consists of three main components:

1. **UML Diagram:** I meticulously crafted a UML diagram outlining the structure and relationships within the application. This diagram serves as a blueprint for the system's architecture, helping to visualize its design and functionality.

2. **Sketch of Screens:** Using Figma and pen-and-paper sketches, We designed the screens envisaged for the program. These sketches provide a visual representation of the user interface elements and layout, facilitating the implementation process.

3. **Java Programs:** Leveraging advanced programming techniques and object-oriented concepts, I developed the core functionality of the system using Java. These programs are designed to efficiently handle the input, processing, and output of employee and member information.

### Development Tools

Throughout the project, I utilized several software tools to aid in its development:

- **StarUML:** This powerful UML modeling tool enabled me to create detailed diagrams illustrating the system's structure and behavior. It provided a visual representation of classes, relationships, and interactions, aiding in the design phase.

- **Figma:** As part of the design process, I utilized Figma to create mockups and prototypes of the user interface. Figma's collaborative features allowed for seamless iteration and feedback, ensuring the final design met user requirements.

- **Netbeans:** For the implementation of Java programs, I relied on Netbeans IDE. Its comprehensive development environment provided a range of features for writing, debugging, and testing code, enhancing productivity throughout the coding process.

This project not only honed my technical skills but also provided valuable experience in project management and collaboration. By integrating various software tools and applying advanced programming techniques, I was able to develop a robust and user-friendly information management system tailored to the needs of both employees and members.
